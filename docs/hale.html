<p>One important method of assessing the health of a population is to ask how long people can expect to live.</p>
<p>Life expectancy, estimate of the average number of additional years that a person of a given age can expect to live. The most common measure of life expectancy is life expectancy at birth. Life expectancy is a hypothetical measure. It assumes that the age-specific death rates for the year in question will apply throughout the lifetime of individuals born in that year. The estimate, in effect, projects the age-specific mortality (death) rates for a given period over the entire lifetime of the population born (or alive) during that time. The measure differs considerably by sex, age, race, and geographic location. Therefore, life expectancy is commonly given for specific categories, rather than for the population in general.</p>
<p>Life expectancy reflects local conditions. In less-developed countries, life expectancy at birth is relatively low, compared with more-developed countries. In some less-developed countries, life expectancy at birth may be lower than life expectancy at age 1, because of high infant mortality rates (commonly due to infectious disease or lack of access to a clean water supply).</p>
<p>Life expectancy is calculated by constructing a life table. A life table incorporates data on age-specific death rates for the population in question, which requires enumeration data for the number of people, and the number of deaths at each age for that population. Those numbers typically are derived from national census and vital statistics data, and from them the average life expectancy for each of the age groups within the population can be calculated.</p>
<p>A life table is a table which shows, for a person at each age, what the probability is of them dying before their next birthday. From this starting point, a number of statistics can be derived and are also included in the table:</p>
<ul>
<li>the probability of surviving any particular year of age</li>
<li>the remaining life expectancy for people at each age</li>
<li>the proportion of the original birth cohort still alive.
Life tables are usually constructed separately for men and for women because of their substantially different mortality rates. The Office of National Statistics is one organisation which produces life tables.</li>
</ul>
<p>Health expectancy measures such as health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE) combine life expectancy (LE) with a measure of health-related quality of life (HRQL) or disability to create an indicator for assessing the combined effects of health and mortality, which is expressed in an intuitive measure similar to that of life expectancy [3]. Furthermore, in populations where life expectancy is increasing, health expectancies can be used to monitor whether the proportion of life spent in health is increasing (compression of morbidity) or decreasing (expansion of morbidity) due to a particular health problem such as insufficient or excess body weight</p>
<p>Health Adjusted Life Expectancy (HALE):</p>
<p>HALE is a measure of population health that takes into account mortality and morbidity. It adjusts overall life expectancy by the amount of time lived in less than perfect health. This is calculated by subtracting from the life expectancy a figure which is the number of years lived with disability multiplied by a weighting to represent the effect of the disability.</p>
<p>If:</p>
<p>A = years lived healthily
B = years lived with disability</p>
<p>A+B = life expectancy</p>
<p>A+fB = healthy life expectancy, where f is a weighting to reflect disability level.</p>
<p>Healthy life expectancy (HALE) is a form of health expectancy that applies disability weights to health states to compute the equivalent number of years of good health that a newborn can expect.</p>
<p>Overall, global HALE at birth in 2015 for males and females combined was 63.1 years, 8.3 years lower than total life expectancy at birth. In other words, poor health resulted in a loss of nearly 8 years of healthy life, on average globally. Global HALE at birth for females was only 3 years greater than that for males. In comparison, female life expectancy at birth was almost 5 years higher than that for males.</p>
<p>HALE at birth ranged from a low of 51.1 years for African males to 70.5 years for females in the WHO European Region. The equivalent “lost” healthy years (LHE = total life expectancy minus HALE) ranged from 13% of total life expectancy at birth in the WHO African Region to 10% the WHO Western Pacific Region</p>

After rank ordering the countries by the HALE values, we selected to create an animation for top 10 and last 10 countries for showing the transition intheir values over the period of years 1990 to 2017.</p>
<p>As we can see from them Japan and Singapore are 2 the places which have maintained their top positions. Andora, Sweden and Iceland inspite of increasing their respective values for HALE drop down in the positions. We think, availibility of better medical facilities along with the development in technology and easy adaptation in other countries as compared to that in these countries might have been the cause for the same. Also, we can see that the bottom most countries are the ones that are still developing ones and have less technological support available for helping them out through the medical situations. Thus, we can say that technological development does play an important role for helping us humans to survive more.

The below graph extends the above one in the sense that it has 40 countries into consideration (Top20 and bottom 20 when ranked based on the HALE values) The still graph with these many countries helps us see the fact that there is wide gap of 15 years when shifting from the 20th country from top to 20th country from bottom. 15 years! A big gap it is for sure...
&lt;img src=&quot;finalproj_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png&quot; width=&quot;1344&quot; /&gt;
Now, let&#39;s shift gears towards analyzing the HALE values for different genders over the countries. Below is the plot showing similar information as the first one, but here we have seperated the values for different genders and as can be seen for almost each country there is a clear trend of females having more HALE as compared to males. STRANGE thing for such a spectacular pattern to exist over all the countries! 

We need to study the different aspects for understanding why the pattern exists and get the answer to the question &quot;Why do women live longer than men?&quot;

Combining the trends for all countries we now show the plots for the values of HALE over the world chloropeth for the year 2017. We have seperated the choropleths into 3 components. 

1- having average values of HALE for both the genders

2- For Females 

3- For Males

Although we get the same insight as from the above graphs and that from looking at the legends that the overall HALE values for females is larger globally. We cannot compare the values countrywise here as there scales are continous and the ranges for both of them being different it is very hard to guage the difference in the values for each of those.

<p>If, we focus on the 4 countries (United States, India, Canada and Zimbabwe) we get the plots as shown below.</p>
<p>The trend guages from these can be summarized as below.
1- The values of HALE for United States are increasing till and then slightly decreasing after the rate of change becomes constant in 2013. The decrease might be due to the effects of global warming affecting the life expectancy of people living in the United States. Also, recenlty in last few years USA has been facing many natural disasters and the decrease might be a result of those as well.
2- The values of HALE for India are increasing at kind of constant rate which is higher than that of Canada but as Canada has already started it from a higher value it is reasonable to not have a higher increase rate.
3- The values of HALE for Zimbabwe is decreasing and is increasing on latter then after 20089. This might be due to various kinds of epidemics that would have resulted in people not being considered as healthy and hence reducing the overall HALE values. A cholera epidemice as for example was prevelant in Zimbabwe in the year 2008.
